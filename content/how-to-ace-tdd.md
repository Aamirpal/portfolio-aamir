# How to Ace TDD

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful methodology that can help you write better, more reliable code. It’s a skill every developer should master.

## What is TDD?

TDD is a development process where you write tests for your features before writing the code to implement them. This approach ensures that your code meets the requirements from the start.

## Steps to Ace TDD

1. **Write a Failing Test**: Start by writing a test that fails because the feature hasn’t been implemented yet.
2. **Write Just Enough Code**: Write the minimal amount of code needed to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code without changing its behavior, ensuring it’s clean and efficient.

### Example: Simple TDD in JavaScript

```javascript
// test/add.test.js
const add = require("../add");

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

// src/add.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;
```

## Benefits of TDD

- **Better Code Quality**: TDD encourages you to think about edge cases and error handling from the beginning.
- **Less Debugging**: With tests in place, you catch bugs early, reducing the time spent debugging later.
