# Why Docker is a Must for Every Developer

In today’s development landscape, Docker has become an indispensable tool for developers. It’s a technology that every developer should be familiar with.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package their applications into containers—standardized units of software that contain everything the application needs to run.

## Benefits of Docker

- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that your application runs the same in development as it does in production.
- **Isolation**: Each Docker container is isolated, preventing conflicts between different applications.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making deployment a breeze.

### Example: Dockerizing a Node.js Application

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source code
COPY . .

# Expose the port and start the application
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

```

```
