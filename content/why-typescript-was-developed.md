# Why TypeScript Was Developed

TypeScript was developed by Microsoft to address some of the limitations of JavaScript, especially in large-scale applications.

## The Need for TypeScript

JavaScript is a dynamic language, which can lead to issues in larger codebases, such as:

- **Lack of Type Safety**: Bugs related to type errors are common and can be difficult to debug.
- **Scalability Issues**: Managing large JavaScript codebases can become challenging as they grow.

## How TypeScript Solves These Issues

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript introduces optional static typing, which helps catch errors during development.
- **Improved Tooling**: TypeScript's type system enables better tooling, such as autocompletion and refactoring support.

### Example: Basic TypeScript Code

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(1, 2); // TypeScript ensures `result` is a number
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript was developed to help developers write more robust and maintainable code, especially in large and complex applications.
