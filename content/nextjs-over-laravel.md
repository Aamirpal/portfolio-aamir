# Why Next.js Over Laravel and Both Use Cases

When deciding on a framework for your web application, both Next.js and Laravel are powerful choices, but they cater to different needs.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js is a React-based framework that allows you to build server-rendered applications with ease. It’s perfect for developers who are comfortable with JavaScript and want a seamless full-stack development experience.

### Key Benefits:

- **SSR and SSG**: Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation are built-in, providing better performance and SEO.
- **API Routes**: Create serverless functions easily, making it a great choice for dynamic content.
- **React Ecosystem**: If your team is proficient in React, Next.js is a natural choice.

### Example: Basic API Route in Next.js

```jsx
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello from Next.js!" });
}
```

## Why Choose Laravel?

Laravel is a PHP-based framework known for its elegant syntax and robust features. It’s an excellent choice for traditional web applications that require complex backend logic.

### Key Benefits:

- **ORM**: Eloquent ORM simplifies database interactions.
- **Blade Templating**: Allows you to create reusable components with ease.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Built-in support for routing, authentication, and more.

### Example: Basic Route in Laravel

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return 'Hello from Laravel!';
});
```

## Use Cases

- **Next.js**: Ideal for modern, dynamic, and SEO-friendly applications that need to leverage the React ecosystem.
- **Laravel**: Best for traditional web applications where PHP is already in use or where complex backend logic is needed.
